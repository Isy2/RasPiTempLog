# RasberryPi Temp Log
Raspberry Pi Java Temperature Logger

# Overview

This is a project I'm working on for a friend who wants to record temperatures on his computer. I'm using a RaspberryPi B+ with
some temperature probes that will input data then output it in a .csv chart.

# In the Future...

...there'll be some wiring info down here, as well as the credits (Pi4J, Oracle, etc.) and maybe sometime a animated chart
like the stuff over at JFreeChart.
